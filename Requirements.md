#KEEP IT SIMPLE
##For the user, and the admin. How are we going to handle the content creation?

##Likes
* Not that much typing to express yourself, rapid fire

## Typical experience
* Come in, say what's on your mind.
* An option for anonymity. A time limit for how long it's up there
  * This part is a big deal
  * For anonymous, and non-anonymous
  * Is still retained in the backend
  * All data for all messages, but not all displayed
  * Mix it all together
  * A time when it's posted, a time when it's deleted
   * A message can have one, both, or neither
* Everyone has an account.
* Time-delay sending. Maybe saving drafts?
* You have to be logged in to do anything. No login, no deal
* Anonymous stuff:
 * A master feed of all anon?
 * A way to search specifically for anon messages?
 * Anon and non-anon mixed in the buckets
* Location-based stuff?
* No re-tweeting
* Info as soon as the app starts. Based on location, interests? Key terms? Have different columns for different things, and be able to drill down into a specific column.
* Be able to sort by time
* Video, image, text, whatever.
* 160 characters to a tweet
 * Multi-part messages?
* What if your bucket is Pacers? What if it's Indiana Pacers?
* Different buckets for explicitly-tagged, and system-found keywords. Did the user specifically tag the message with the keyword?
* Accounts should have enough info to identify people. People should not be able to have multiple accounts.
* Users will already have Facebook or Google oooor email/password
