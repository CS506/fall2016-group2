##Requirements
* Feature
  * User Story
    * Task
* Messages can be given times to automatically be posted, or automatically removed. A message be given both, either, or neither of these times.
 * As the Message Creator, I want to be able to write a post and have it be automatically posted some time in the future. I also want posts to be able to have an expiration time when they are automatically removed. I want both of these features to be optional.
* Buckets
 * As the Message Reader, I would like to have messages organized for me because finding messages that I care about can be difficult.
* 160 characters per message.
  * As the Message Reader, I do not like reading alot of text because it is boring. The more text, the scarier the post.
* Image and video support
  * As the Message Creator, I would like to post message with images/videos because more information can be conveyed to a reader and it's an outlet for creativity.
  * As the Message Reader, I would like to have message with images/videos because text only posts can become bland, having visuals can be more entertaining.
* Social network login or sign up facility
  * As the User, I would like to use my facebook account to login because I will not need to remember any more passwords.
  * As the system, I would like users to login with another service because managing user accounts is painful.
  * As the coder, I would like users to login with another server because this way I do not have to worry about account creation, validation, security, account recovery, and possibly account deletion.
* Anonymous tweeting
  * As the Message Creator, I would like an option for anonymous messages because sometimes I don't want words to be connected back to me.
  * As the Message Reader, I want to be able to find messages that are interesting to me even if they are posted anonymously.
* Search using hashtags
 * As the Message Creator, I want to be able to give my messages hashtags so my messages can be catagorized for Readers.
 * As the Message Reader, I want to be able to search for messages by hashtags to help me find messages that I care about.
* Timelined tweeting
  * As the Message Creator, I do not want everything I say to be connected back to me because sometimes I may say things that create trouble.
* Time sorting on tweets
  * As the Message Reader, I want to categorize messages by time because sometimes I am only interested in current events and othertimes I am only interested in messages from a long-time ago.




#KEEP IT SIMPLE
##For the user, and the admin. How are we going to handle the content creation?

##Likes
* Not that much typing to express yourself, rapid fire

##Dislikes

## Typical experience
* Come in, say what's on your mind.
* An option for anonymity. A time limit for how long it's up there
  * This part is a big deal
  * For anonymous, and non-anonymous
  * Is still retained in the backend
  * All data for all messages, but not all displayed
  * Mix it all together
  * A time when it's posted, a time when it's deleted
   * A message can have one, both, or neither
* Everyone has an account.
* Time-delay sending. Maybe saving drafts?
* You have to be logged in to do anything. No login, no deal
* Anonymous stuff:
 * A master feed of all anon?
 * A way to search specifically for anon messages?
 * Anon and non-anon mixed in the buckets
* Location-based stuff?
* No re-tweeting
* Info as soon as the app starts. Based on location, interests? Key terms? Have different columns for different things, and be able to drill down into a specific column.
* Be able to sort by time
* Video, image, text, whatever.
* 160 characters to a tweet
 * Multi-part messages?
* What if your bucket is Pacers? What if it's Indiana Pacers?
* Different buckets for explicitly-tagged, and system-found keywords. Did the user specifically tag the message with the keyword?
* Accounts should have enough info to identify people. People should not be able to have multiple accounts.
* Users will already have Facebook or Google oooor email/password
