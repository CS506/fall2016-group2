##Project Reqirements New
* Post Creation
  * My posts are limited to 160 characters. __Testable__
    * As the Message Reader, I do not like reading alot of text because it is boring. The more text, the scarier the post.
  * I can attach images no greater than 1024x512 to my posts. __Testable__
    * As the Message Creator, I would like to post message with images/videos because more information can be conveyed that way and I want to express my creative side.
    * As the Message Reader, I would like to have message with images/videos because text only posts are boring and having something to look at is more entertaining.

    * As the Message Creator, I want to be able to give my messages hashtags so my messages can be easily found.
    * As the Message Reader, I want to be able to search for messages by hashtags to help me find messages that I care about.

* Post Sharing
  * I can assign an optional start time for displaying my posts. __Testable__
    * As the Message Creator, I want to be able to write a message and have it be automatically posted/removed by a time I choose because sometimes I think of stuff to say for certain events and times of the day.
  * If my post contains an optional start time, it becomes viewable once the start time has elapsed. Otherwise it becomes viewable immediately. __Testable__
  * I can assign an optional stop time for displaying my posts.
    * As the Message Creator, I do not want everything I say to be connected back to me because sometimes I may say things that create trouble.
  * If my post contains an optional stop time, it becomes hidden once the stop time has elapsed. Otherwise it is viewable indefinitely.
  * I can choose to share my posts anonymously.
    * As the Message Creator, I would like an option for anonymous messages because sometimes I don't want words to be connected back to me.
    * As the Message Reader, I want to be able to find anonymous posts because sometimes I don't want to know who wrote those words.

* Buckets
  * I can see posts organized in collections of related material called buckets.
  * My front page contains many buckets which I can view where a front page will display atleast 1 bucket, the "Latest Posts" bucket, by default __Testable__
  * I can specify which buckets I prefer to see on my front page.
  * The most recent post is displayed first in a bucket. __Testable__
    * As the Message Reader, I want to categorize messages by time because sometimes I am only interested in current events and othertimes I am only interested in messages from a long-time ago.
  * Have the ability to refresh the posts on a bucket. This could be either a button or a swipe down action on mobile.

* Log in and account creation
  * I would like to use my facebook or google account to login. __Testable__
    * As the User, I would like to use my facebook or google account to login because I won't need to remember any more passwords.
    * As the system, I would like users to login with another service because managing user accounts is painful.
    * As the coder, I would like users to login with another service because this way I do not have to worry about account creation, validation, security, account recovery, and possibly account deletion.
